### Algorithm Challenge

Create LinkedList and Node classes and try to implement the methods to add a new Node to the Linked List and search for a specific Node in the list. For simplification, each Node's "data" attribute will simply be a String. As a reminder:

Linked Lists have a .head property that points to the first Node in the list.

Nodes have a .data property (that will hold onto a String for our purposes) and a .next property that points to the next Node in the list.
